## Who I am:


Here are some ideas to get you started:

I'm a semi-beginner in Python, the point of this github is for me to track my progression from starting as a stupid, ineffable idiot programmer. 
From a master, sigma-male, genius programmer.

This repository will contain various video-game recreations, and alculators.

In the future I hope to either learn SQL or Java.
